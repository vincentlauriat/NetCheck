## Install

Grab the latest `.dmg` from the [Releases page](https://github.com/vincentlauriat/NetCheck/releases/latest), mount it, and drag `NetCheck.app` to `/Applications`.

**Requirements:** macOS 26 or later.

Releases are signed with an Apple Developer ID, built with the Hardened Runtime, and notarized by Apple — they open without any Gatekeeper warning.

## Build from source

**Requirements:** macOS 26+, Xcode 16+, [XcodeGen](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen).

```bash
brew install xcodegen
git clone https://github.com/vincentlauriat/NetCheck.git
cd NetCheck
xcodegen generate
open NetCheck.xcodeproj
```

Or use the build script:

```bash
./Scripts/build.sh run   # build Debug + launch
```

## Architecture

Three targets, strict Swift 6 concurrency, no sandbox:

| Target | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `NetCheckCore` | Network logic — actors, async/await, zero UI |
| `NetCheckUI` | Shared SwiftUI components — Liquid Glass panels, `OrganicBubble`, `FeatureWindowBackground` |
| `NetCheck` | App assembly — `NSStatusItem`, `WindowManager`, feature views |

See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for the full design.
